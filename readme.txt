Hello svetoslav Im very happy for staring to work with you .
============================================================

here i Will explain you things about our game , the graphicl will be very low for the starting ,we will not
have desings for the chartacters in the game , we will work on very basic objects , after that we will
purshase 3d objects from characters designers when we will be ready , the most important thig now is to
make as good network as we can , I want the identity of ther users in thegame to be on the cellular number
and not with the mail number , similar as whatsap to recognize the user with qr code , but not for now .

for now every body who enters the url of the game from a browzer automaticly they enter the game ,
so no need the google authentications , in the game it will be a world where you have people
you can select them and tell them where to go and what to do , they will gather 
resources like stones wood metal money & cripto coins (real in the future) and they will build 
buildings tools , similar to settlers game 
there will be wars and trade between the gamers .

So there are a few main problems that we want to take care about : 
There two modes of view in the game - 
  1 from up or from character view . when you look from up it is like warcraft
    game when you select units and control them to walk where you tell them .
  2 from human view where you play like couter strike and shoot people.
  
  
So this is the start now we make a world where you control on units and tell them where to go
and we want to look from the unit view .
so this is our main goal now. to make units and control them from two types of views.

sorry from my write mistakes :)
